//34.Determine overlapping numbers in ranges  
/** Problem
You will be given an array with 5 numbers. The first 2 numbers represent a range, and the next two numbers represent another range. The final number in the array is X. The goal of your program is to determine if both ranges overlap by at least X numbers. For example, in the array [4, 10, 2, 6, 3] the ranges 4 to 10 and 2 to 6 overlap by at least 3 numbers (4, 5, 6), so your program should return true. Solve with and without looping.
If the array is [10, 20, 4, 14, 4] then the ranges are:
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
These ranges overlap by at least 4 numbers, namely: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 so your program should return true.*/

module.exports = function OverlappingRanges(arr) {

    // keep a count of how many numbers overlap
    var counter = 0;
    
    // loop through one of the ranges
    for (var i = arr[0]; i < arr[1]; i++) {
  
      // check if a number within the first range exists
      // in the second range
      if (i >= arr[2] && i <= arr[3]) { 
        counter += 1;
      }
  
    }
   
    // check if the numbers that overlap is equal to or greater
    // than the last number in the array
    return (counter >= arr[4]) ? true : false;
