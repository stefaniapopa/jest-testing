//36.Step-by-step solution for step counting using recursion  
/**Problem
Suppose you want climb a staircase of N steps, and on each step you can take either 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways are there to climb the staircase? For example, if you wanted to climb 4 steps, you can take the following distinct number of steps:
1) 1, 1, 1, 1
2) 1, 1, 2
3) 1, 2, 1
4) 2, 1, 1
5) 2, 2
So there are 5 distinct ways to climb 4 steps. We want to write a function, using recursion, that will produce the answer for any number of steps.
Answer
The solution to this problem requires recursion, which means to solve for a particular N, we need the solutions for previous N's. The solution for N steps is equal to the solutions for N - 1 steps plus N - 2 steps. */

module.exports = function countSteps(N) {
  
    // just as in our solution explanation above, we know that to climb 1 step
    // there is only 1 solution, and for 2 steps there are 2 solutions
    if (N === 1) { return 1; }
    if (N === 2) { return 2; }
    
    // for all N > 2, we add the previous (N - 1) + (N - 2) steps to get
    // an answer recursively
    return countSteps(N - 1) + countSteps(N - 2);
